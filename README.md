# code-protection-by-obsfuscated-code

Readable and understandable programming
Should not use my style of code in text file

It is my style of code protection using in python and JavaScript starting from 2022 July

If compile in byte code, it had better done in virtual machine with SGX.

If you are Junior programmer, I do not suggest using this style of code
It is reference from stackoverflow and edited for own use only.

If obsfucated enough , you can insert random number generation after each 
line of code to make cpu viewer can not easy to see your code in assembly language.

There are random number of hash and encryption that can choose to use to further
Obfuscated code
